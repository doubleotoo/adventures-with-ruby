  <p>I am making some acceptance tests for the LevenAls website, using plain text stories from <a href="http://blog.davidchelimsky.net/articles/2007/10/25/plain-text-stories-part-iii">David Chelimsky</a> together with the Selenium runner from  Kerry Buckley (http:&#47;&#47;www.kerrybuckley.com&#47;2007&#47;11&#47;07&#47;driving-selenium-from-the-rspec-story-runner-rbehave&#47;)</p>
  <pre>Story: Selenium clicking a label
  
  As a developer
  I wanted to make acceptence tests
  So I installed Cucumber and Selenium
  
    Scenario: Writing clean tests
      When I wanted to make the stories as clean as possible
      And I wanted to click a rails generated radiobutton
      Then the story became ugly
      And it had lines like 'the user clicks a customer_gender_m button'
  
    Scenario: I made a step for labels, getting the text
      When I wanted to get rid of it
      And I couldn't find an easy answer
      And I spent the better part of my evening googling it
      Then I made a post on the Selenium forum
      And asked for advice
  
    Scenario: I found a solution myself
      When I was sitting in the train
      And I was trying all kinds of solutions
      Then I stumbled upon the solution
      And I was overjoyed
      And it was: $selenium.click("//label[text()='#{label}']")
  </pre>
  <p>So here is the entire step:</p>
  <pre>When "the user clicks on a $element labelled $label" do |element, label|
    $selenium.click "//label[text()='#{label}']"
  end
  </pre>
