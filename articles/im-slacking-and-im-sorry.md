I was about to do lots of work for the <a href="http://rails-i18n.googlegroups.com">i18n-community</a>, improving the <a href="http://rails-i18n.org">website</a>, managing the fork requests of <a href="http://github.com/joshmh/globalize2/tree/master">Globalize 2</a>, improving the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html">official Rails guide</a> and more. But instead, I just slowed down developing in my spare time, letting the community down in the process.

Now it's not that they need me, but I felt like I was making a contribution. I felt obligated to do as much open source as possible and my already busy schedule kept getting busier. Then suddenly I couldn't get myself to do it anymore.

Lately, what I do when I come home after work is read up on my RSS feeds, check the i18n mailing list to see if I can be of any assistance, and more than once just read a book at night. Finding a bit of a balance between work and relaxation. And this is a more pleasant schedule for me and one I can keep up with.

I also had a streak of bad luck these last few weeks. My washing machine died (it was 23 years old, so it didn't really come as a big surprise), my server died, my graphics card in my desktop died, my heating is still dead (a mechanic is coming on Monday), and I have caught an annoying cold.

So, I am sorry about my absence. Hopefully it'll improve during the coming months. All the much respect to all those programmers that do continue working at night for days on end.

<h3>So, what have I been doing?</h3>

Well, I worked through the fork queue of my <a href="http://github.com/iain/http_accept_language/tree/master">http_accept_language</a> plugin, merging in some improvements and making it compatible with Rails 2.3.

Furthermore, I'm busy making some changes to <a href="http://github.com/ryanb/nifty-generators/tree/master">Ryan Bates' Nifty generators</a> so that they don't use fixtures anymore, use Authlogic, and add some minor adjustments to what I found to be very useful when trying to do <abbr title="Rapid Application Development">RAD</abbr>. You shouldn't use it just yet.

And finally, I'm trying to come up with a way of making forms that doesn't hurt. ActionView::FormBuilder is nice, but if you need a lot of forms, it can become tedious. I'm trying to automate it more, while keeping as much flexibility as possible. It's a difficult process to find out what actually is the handiest. I am making progress though.

And finally, I will be trying to blog a bit more. I'm ashamed that this is the first post of 2009.
