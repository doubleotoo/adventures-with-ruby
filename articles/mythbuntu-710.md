Before I came to that, let me tell you what kind of problems I had after upgrading to gutsy gibbon. I have a server, playing webserver with postfix, courier and dspam, performing the noble task of webserver (as you can see), file server, but certainly not least of all: it is my mythtv master backend. Master being the only backend in this case. I have a sparkling <a href="http://www.antec.com/us/productDetails.php?ProdID=15738" title="Antec Fusion" target="_blank">Antec Fusion</a> as a mythtv frontend. Having done a real skinny installation with feisty, I decided to upgrade to gutsy. Problems arose.

It started with my screensaver. It didn't detect activity anymore from my remote or from playing videos. So I had to press a button or move my mouse every 10 minutes. Second, and I had that problem from the start: samba shares would not mount properly at boot time. I had no clue, neither did any log file.  After a kernel upgrade to 2.6.22-14, I could not get my remote to work (<a href="http://infx.nl/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/harmony525.jpg" title="Logitech Harmony 525">Logitech Harmony 525</a>, posing as a Hauppauge pvr350 remote, using a Philips USB infrared receiver; why shouldn't it be complicated?).<!--more-->

I would install a fresh MythBuntu 7.10. First time I downloaded it, there were some errors on the cd, but the second time, it worked. Installation was done in a wimp, no problems at all. Now for the configuring. It started with my favorite theme '<a href="http://infx.nl/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/mythcenter.gif" title="MythCenter theme for MythTV">MythCenter</a>' all in Widescreen, the right resolution for my <a href="http://infx.nl/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/samsungtv.jpg" title="Samsung le32r82b">Samsung le32r82b</a>. My guess is that it took those settings from my previous installation, or that they are somewhere in the 'mythconverg'-database. It is such a mess, so any setting might or might not be in there. Of course I had to install updates, proprietary drivers and lots more, but this being Ubuntu, it all worked!

In the live cd version of the frontend it provided me with a nice interface for getting my videos from samba. I was pretty impressed how that was done, but once I installed it, I couldn't find it anywhere. It looked for my videos in the same spot it once did, so I had to do the samba installation manually.

The remote wasn't working anymore after installing it, which I found rather odd. There is definitely a big difference between the live cd and the installed version, which is a pity. It looks like the developers did a great job, but focussed on the first impressions, but the rest is a bit less. I managed to make my remote working by letting it emulate a Windows Media Center remote and setting that in the mythbuntu control center. By the way, speaking of first impressions, the official mythbuntu theme is quite nice.

I regret not having installed a backend with mythbuntu, but my backend is still working perfectly and it's not worth it doing the installation of postfix etc all over again. If I had a backend to install, I certainly would use mythbuntu. I even believe it would be doable for a non-linux nerd, but you'd have to be a nerd nevertheless. I would mark it with a <strong>8 out of 10</strong>. Excellent!
