I haven't forgotten you all, it just has been a very busy few weeks, and it will stay that way for the moment. Next month and a half I'll be spending finishing up a nice big Ruby on Rails application, currently having over 2500 lines of code (LOC of course) and 2000 lines of test code, doing a thousand assertions. I'll keep you posted on that one.

I am finally done re-ordering my music. Having 10,000 songs is a lot, and having to add cover art, proper release years and genres is a pain in the ass. It took me a bunch of weekends but the result is nice... (thank you <a href="http://mediamonkey.com" title="MediaMonkey music editor homepage">MediaMonkey</a>)

Now getting it on my iPod was an interesting challenge. My iPod should be big enough to contain it all, but <a href="http://winamp.com" title="Winamp: it really really really whips the llama's ass!">WinAmp </a>fucked it all up. Using the sync button it put more than one copy of a song on my iPod and when it had only 16KB free space, it couldn't story the database, so all my songs were orphaned. Then it couldn't find my iPod anymore, so I had to use up to 4 different applications. But luckily I didn't have to install iTunes to get it fixed.<!--more-->

iTunes symbolizes everything that is wrong with Apple. It's a big and slow, treats you like a moron, giving you no option but drag-n-drop 'till you drop. It's never really clear what it is doing, and why it is doing it. I sure didn't ask for my music to be scanned for gapless playback. It can't rescan my music directory, or if it could, the option is tucked away somewhere, never to be found. It has no proper playlist, no jump function. It uses a shitload of memory, it install needless services like ipodhelper.exe. It gives you iTunes, the most expensive music store ever. Why in hell would I want to buy an album in mp3 format for the same price as the original? If they even have the songs I like. It comes with quicktime, which should be a reason on it's own to hate it. Now add expensive, but cheap hardware to the list, and you'll have Apple... Even as a big <a href="http://ubuntu.com" title="Ubuntu!!!!">Ubuntu </a>fan, I like Microsoft more.

Sorry for ranting on there for a bit. It aggravated me to death, so I had to let it all go for a moment.
